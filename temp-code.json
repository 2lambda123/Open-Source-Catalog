Deforming geometry simulations can be carried out using this solver. The technology can also be used in a low-order mode as a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. Any flow regime-from incompressible flow to hypersonic flow about arbitrary geometries-can be simulated using EDLFLOW-F."

The CAPIO system is designed specifically for multi-input/multi-output applications and this implementation utilizes 1) on-line estimation of phase lag introduced by control surface rate limiting, 2) on-line adjustment of control allocation weighting terms, and 3) an optimization algorithm (available from MathWorks) that calculates the optimal control solution."

The key tools used in producing the nowcasts and forecasts are simulation models including biogeochemical and ecosystem models that estimate the states (vegetation leaf area, biomass, soil moisture, snow, etc.) and functions (evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, etc.) of various kinds of plant canopies (forests, crops, grass, shrubs). These ecological nowcasts and forecasts are akin to current and forecast weather conditions. Upon further refinement and testing, the ecological nowcasts and forecasts are useful for making a variety of management decisions such as irrigation scheduling, timing of field operations, preparing for floods/droughts, vector-borne diseases, crop phenology and production.

The tool offers a reliable method for calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. The program works by reading test data files and determining maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of random loading spectra in order to calculate theoretical crack growth. The innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure."

Optimization can then take place within each discipline module, or in a loop between the central executive module and the discipline modules, or both. This version uses  a public-domain optimization code, Automated Design Synthesis (ADS) version 1.10, instead of using the DOT code.

      "description": "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.\r\n\r\nmagnetic bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance."

This technology is a NASA Glenn-developed software application that supports fault management (FM) by performing testability analyses on the fault propagation model of a given system. The Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool processes a diagnostic model developed from a commercial software package called TEAMS Designer using a defined set of modeling conventiuons and practices. ETA Tool can provide an assessment of the modeled system based on diagnostic metrics of detectability and failure isolation. The program can provide assessment of a system's detection coverage, test utilization, failure isolation at the root cause or at the component levels, generate a FMEA Report, perform sensor sensitivity studies and provide a trace-mapping of failure modes to higher level system effects. ETA Tool generates reports from each selected analysis option in both an HTML and XML format to enable user access in either standard web browsers or loadable into an Microsoft Excel workbook for review/editing."

      "description": "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited"

      "description": "A calculational procedure has been designed and implemented in software that enables the specification and design of a space-based optical communications system.  The resulting optical link budget essentially accounts for the communication power flow through the entire optical communications channel from the transmitter to the receiver and yields design specifications for the optical system necessary to assure reliable data transmission with desired operational metrics such as data rate, link margin, etc.  The link budget takes into account all the sources of deleterious noise that enters into the communications process such as electronically generated noise in the optical detector and stray optical irradiance from external sources.  The link budget has the capability of being interfaced with the orbital element calculations of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to allow the dynamic description and evolution of optical link operation from any space-borne satellite within the solar system to and from the earth."

The innovation allows snapshots of a radio's receiver environment for any number of objectives, such as interference mitigation or radio frequency mapping.  Digital samples are acquired and stored in the radio's memory for processing, be that on-board the spacecraft or after download to the ground.  The application is labeled \"Test waveform\" because it does not perform any standard communication link functions, such as carrier recovery or demodulation.  Depending on the radio's resources and architecture, this application could be run in parallel with a standard communications link waveform application."

Viscous effects, and heat transfer effects are modeled using source terms.  The effects of potential inlet flow reversals are modeled using boundary conditions.  Output from the simulation compares favorably to measured data from numerous experimental RDE rigs.  The speed and fidelity of the code render it useful as a performance optimization tool as well as a diagnostic tool to supplement the current limitations of experimental measurement techniques in the hostile engine environment."

This system uses a single, industry-standard protocol, to ease integration with other products, and uses both COTS, GOTS and public domain software to form a single, cohesive system. It is composed of several parts:\r\n\r\nThe Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Testing (ASIST) is the user-interface, providing user with the ability to view and analyze telemetry, send commands, and automate tests. The Front End Data System reads telemetry from spacecrafts, distributing requested data packets to subscribing clients; additionally, it controls the forward (command) link to the spacecraft, formatting command packets so that the spacecraft can read them and verifying that commands are transferred correctly. The Digital History Data Store (DHDS) archives the raw telemetry received from the spacecraft and distributes historical telemetry data to clients.\r\n\r\nThis system can be configured in a number of ways. For small labs, a single ASIST workstation may be used, while in I&T or mission operations, the configuration may include up to 31 ASIST workstations. All configurations provide the user with the same standard interface to their flight hardware."

The decoder uses the minimum sum algorithm with an attenuation multiplier of 0.75 and 6-bit saturating arithmetic. The decoder does 14 iterations per block and generates a dot product for the last iteration. Data is input and output as 7-bit probabilities of 6 bits each per cycle."

Employing a comprehensive standardization methodology, Kameleon allows heterogeneous model output to be stored uniformly in a common science data format. The converted files contain both the original model output as well as additional metadata elements to create platform-independent and self-descriptive data files. Kameleon facilitates model data dissemination, data reuse, and code reuse."

In the modular GRASP architecture, all operating system and hardware interfaces are isolated within GRASP libraries. The application developer uses GRASP interface libraries and device drivers to interact with external hardware. Should a new hardware item require a driver, that development would be part of GRASP and would be added to the GRASP interface libraries and become available for future projects. GRASP application software is developed by using the GRASP template, which offers access to the services GRASP provides. The templated generic code handles process initialization, thread creation, inter-process messaging, process health monitoring, data logging, data distribution, etc., with hooks that provide for subsystem tailoring. Using GRASP allows application developers to concentrate on mission specifics, reducing development time, cost, and risk."

      "description": "Applications based upon pseudospectral algorithms share many characteristics and present common challenges to developers pushing the limits of high performance computing. Each investigation team generally tackles these challenges independently and reach various plateaus of performance that are well below those that are theoretically and demonstrably achievable. At the same time, pseudospectral algorithms have many unique characteristics that limit the applicability/efficacy of many software frameworks used by the high performance computing community. Such characteristics include \"transposes\" - large redistributions of data across an entire computing platform, nontrivial computational domains (e.g. spherical harmonic modes), little-or-no nearest-neighbor communication, and high computational intensity (DGEMM, FFT, etc). The goals of SpF (Spectral Framework) are to (1) reduce complexity and duplication of effort across multiple investigation teams, (2) achieve near optimal scalability on existing computing architectures (10\"4-10\"5 cores), (3) provide automation for domain decomposition and load balancing that circumvent hardwired constraints in existing applications, (4) provide automated and optimized global data \"transpososes\" that dominate compute time for large problems, (5) provide access to optimized numerical libraries including libraries implemented on hardware accelerators, and (6) provide a flexible/optimized input/output layer."

      "description": "The Bundle Protocol (BP) is an international standard produced by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Standards (CCSDS).  It is a key piece of the planned Interplanetary Internet.  The basic idea is that BP is given bundles to deliver, and it delivers them to their specified destination, using the appropriate route.  For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center.  For each hop along the way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol.  For example, to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp).  Generally, the lower-level protocol is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops).\r\n\r\nThe Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission designers.   It has been developed for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission and the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) group.  It is useful for any organization (commercial or otherwise) that is interested in being part of the Interplanetary Internet."

It distributes commands to, and collects data from, all spacecraft subsystems and  the science instruments.  The FSW controls high gain antenna pointing to TDRSS satellites and manages communications with the ground controllers in real time to receive commands (during SSA contacts) and send housekeeping telemetry data during SSA and MA contacts.  It sends science data using the Class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).  The GPM FSW monitors the health of  most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.  \r\nThe GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power,  and the pointing of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS.   The GPM FSW uses the propulsion system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion.  The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform \"yaw maneuvers\" to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees.\r\nThe GPM FSW uses Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission use.\r\n"

The software provides an analyst with a quick, easy-to-use, accurate, and repeatable method to perform and document root cause analysis, identify corrective actions, perform trending analysis, and generate usable data for probabilistic risk assessment. All possible causes of accidents-hardware, software, the environment, weather, natural phenomena, external events, human error-can be incorporated into the timeline and fault/causal factor trees. The software features an intuitive logic diagramming capability and uses standard terminology, definitions, and symbols."

This software is used to build a precision structure, like a really big telescope, which would deploy in space. Since lightweight deployment mechanisms aren't accurate enough for high-resolution optical telescopes, the laser metrology system measure distances on the deployed structure. The phasemeter is the stage of the metrology system that laser relative phases into distance measurements, which are used to actively control the structure with sub-micron accuracy. "

To meet these requirements, MSLICE delivers a rich feature set which includes but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n1) Simple, intuitive, and powerful search capability.  For any given mission there is a huge amount of data and associated metadata that is generated.  Quickly and easily sifting through all the data to find the interesting products requires a powerful tool with an intuitive interface.  MSLICE provides such an interface in much the same way that the major Internet search engines provide a tool for searching the internet.\r\n2) Visualization of the rover's traverse in a HiRISE image.  This view is basically a map of the mission, and it allows scientists to easily gauge where the rover has been and where they would like it to go.  The map also provides the ability to correct or adjust the known position of the rover through the technique of overlaying images acquired from the rover on top of the HiRISE image.  A user can then correct the rover's position by collocating the visible features in the overlays with the same features in the underlying HiRISE image.\r\n3) Visualization of data products and the ability to view mosaics."

Efficient team collaboration in the DSN utilization planning phase ensures the efficient use of the antennas, thus reducing the cost of DSN operations. Team collaboration during planning is also expected to reduce space flight mission costs by reducing the overhead associated with the DSN resource allocation process and by lowering antenna negotiation time and schedule rework required. GRAPE provides a team collaboration environment where all documents, team knowledge, and applications come to a single access point."

These header files are created from an XML file describing the interface, and they define constants that allow a programmer to use each register and to access each individual field in the register. The XML Parser is run as part of the make process, which ensures that whenever an interface is changed, all of the code that uses the header files describing it is recompiled."

The Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) communication system is an implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols for space flight operations. It enables reliable automatic data communication over a network of arbitrarily complex topology comprising both deep-space links and more Internet-like connections. CFDP-ION includes implementations of the optional Proxy and Remote Directory Listing interoperable user operations defined in the CFDP standard. CFDP-ION utilizes the Interplanetary Communication Infrastructure (ICI) application interface offered by ION to invoke any operating system functionality that is not common to all POSIX-compliant operating systems. This enables CFDP-ION to be used without modification in VxWorks 5.4, Solaris 9, OS/X, and various Linux distributions. "

It is also directly applicable to robotics landers on the moon, other planets and small bodies. It could be used as a sensor approach for navigation of autonomous air vehicles for military and surveillance purposes."

When the double differenced combination of phase biases can be fixed reliably a significant improvement in solution accuracy is obtained. The procedure is complicated and compute intensive, due to the need for multiple receivers to form the double difference. The constraint on the integers is added to the solution as a measurement with infinite precision. This software introduces a new method. First the process, uses a large global set of GPS receivers (40-80 receivers) to solve for the GPS satellite orbits and clocks ( along with many other parameters ). "

      "description": "The long-term evolution characteristics (and stability) of an orbit are best charac-terized using a mean element propagation of the perturbed two body variational equations of motion. The averaging process eliminates short period terms leaving only secular and long period effects. In this software a non-traditional approach is taken that averages the variational equations using adaptive numerical techniques and then numerically integrating the resulting EOMs. Doing this avoids the Fourier series expansions and truncations required by the traditional analytic methods. The resultant numerical techniques can be easily adapted to propagations at most solar system bodies. "

The bundle protocol is used in DTNs which overlay multiple networks, some of which may be challenged by limitations such as intermittent and possibly unpredictable loss of connectivity, long or variable delay, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. The purpose of the bundle protocol is to support interoperability across such stressed networks."

Combining both the retrieval and simulation tasks in a single piece of software makes it far easier to ensure that identical forward model algorithms and parameters are used in both tasks and dramatically reduces the complexity of the code maintenance effort. The unique features of this software lies with the instrument and its unique capabilities to measure the atmospheric temperatures and composition at the earth's limb."

The algorithm is based on a primal-dual formulation of the dynamics that captures the interaction forces (dual formulation variables) between bodies, which is particularly useful for control and estimation analysis and synthesis. Furthermore, the dynamics model for each body can easily be replaced by a new model without re-deriving the overall equations of motion, and the assembly of the equations of motion is done automatically.

This software tool is used for the multi-body simulation of a spacecraft with a robotic arm and a sampling mechanism, which performs a touch-and-go (TAG) maneuver for sampling from the surface of a small celestial body. G-TAG utilizes G-DYN, a multi-body simulation engine, and interfaces to controllers, estimators, and environmental forces that affect the spacecraft. G-TAG can easily be adapted for the analysis of stress cases to assist the design of a TAG system as well as for comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations to analyze a particular TAG system."

As the FPGA technology at JPL matures from \"glue-logic\" chips to full-fledged instrument processors, we will need to improve our ability to test, verify, and validate these designs. "

The tool serves as a single application that will maintain guest and mission information, run standard reports, email guests, produce mailing labels, and export data. Via the Internet, invited guests can access EGO Web pages from all over the world to register their attendance intentions, access relevant mission data, and update their contact information. After guest registration, administrative support personnel have used EGO to maintain guest-seating assignments, send email communications, maintain attendance to special receptions, and gather security information for foreign guests. EGO replaces a very paper-intensive process, saves a significant amount in postage costs, and reduces error-prone data entry. The tool has been built with flexibility and customization in mind. Its initial scope was broadened to also serve as the login for people invited to view an International Space Station Friends and Family Web site created by Wyle Life Sciences. The Constellation program also used EGO to invite guests to attend the Pad Abort (PA-1) test flight in 2010."

Additional modules have been added to allow correspondence management/tracking and Space Station Review Board action tracking. The legal office action-tracking module can isolate legal documents from the general document repository. JATS also has a full ad hoc search and reporting capability. Reporting features allow hierarchical organizational managers to track and report on the actions of subordinates. The system uses NASA-approved authentication methods and is 508 compliant."

Text fields in problem report data records (e.g., discrepancy reports, problem reports, corrective-action reports, and software change reports) might contain information that is critical to finding trends and groupings of recurring problems. STAT overcomes problems with scoping by linking up meaningful phrases that could be separated by text (e.g., \"not aligned\" versus \"not completely aligned\"). STAT's use of hierarchical ontologies overcomes the limitations of data codes, which are flat, closed, and have small sets of values that are often difficult to interpret. The ontology organizes aerospace terminology in hierarchies of types of problems, properties, objects, and functions. The tool identifies and tags types of problems and equipment mentioned in text fields, thereby providing new data files for record keeping. These new data files support text mining and clustering, report generation, browsing, and search at various levels of abstraction."

Martin Marietta Corp. developed the program, called UD233A, for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. DSS was used to study performance of parachute descent of flight test vehicle versions of the NASA Orion space craft. DSS incorporates 6 degrees of translational and rotational motion for both the vehicle and attached parachute, It models the deployment and inflation of the parachute system. DSS has separate aerodynamic and mass properties for both the vehicle and parachute.\r\nDSS is an in-house analysis tool.

The tool models a system's components, their connective relationships, and functions in order to assist in Failure Modes and Effect analysis (FMEA) early in the design lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the tool is to semi-automatically generate a model with functions and failure modes to support FMEA.  This will be accomplished by:\r\nA graphical component-connection model is created by arranging and connecting components selected from the Master Equipment list.\r\n\r\nFor each component, a pick-list user interface asks a few questions to narrow down potential failure modes.  This uses a failure mode library in MS Excel based on standard failure modes and associated component functions and features.\r\n\r\nPick-lists for types failure mode causes and immediate effects help the analyst complete initial draft FMEA worksheets, which link to the components in the model.\r\n\r\nThe graphical model, which is marked with redundant components and paths, shows upstream/downstream dependencies, to help the analyst add further effects and criticality to the FMEA worksheets.\r\n\r\nThis tool is innovative because it saves analysis time and provides a standardized and systematic approach in failure analysis, thereby enabling risk mitigation early in system design.  There are also potential benefits of tool use during the operations phase to identify the cause(s) of a fault or failure.   \r\n"

      "description": "The GFE Lo-Fi Chutes Model provides basic modeling capability of a sequential series of parachute activities.  Actions include deploying the parachute, changing the reefing on the parachute, and cutting away the parachute.  Multiple chutes can be deployed at any given time, but all chutes in that case are assumed to behave as individually isolated chutes; there is no modeling of any interactions between deployed chutes.  Drag characteristics of a deployed chute are based on a coefficient of drag, the face-area of the chute, and the local dynamic pressure only.  The orientation of the chute is approximately modeled for purposes of obtaining torques on the vehicle, but the dynamic state of the chute as a separate entity is not integrated, the treatment is simply an approximation. \r\n\r\nPlans for every post-shuttle manned vehicle which will reenter Earth's atmosphere, or for that matter, the Martian atmosphere, include a descent phase controlled by some sort of parachute system.  Having a NASA-certified parachute model which can be plugged into various flight simulators is a huge advantage.  Building a special purpose parachute simulator for a specific simulation is at least a million dollar job.  Lockheed Martin had to do exactly that in order to support Pad Abort I, and GFEChutes Lo-Fi was tested against the Lockheed prototype.  \r\n\r\nHaving a verified, Class C parachute model, packaged in a reusable (plug-and-play) form, is smart technically and an outstanding strategic move as we enter the world of commercial manned space flight.

      "description": "The code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks) has been developed over the last years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of ionizing radiations at the microscopic scale and to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a step-by-step diffusion-reaction program based on the Greens functions of the diffusion equation. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs. "

      "description": "The DEBRIS software performs particle tracking within an overset grid system from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution.  The particle tracking is based on the particle's mass properties and local aerodynamic characteristics within the flowfield.  The software allows the user to specify the location and initial conditions for release of the particle.  The code then traces the particle's ballistic trajectory (i.e. any lift force is ignored) through the grid system.  The resulting trajectory is output to a file which can be viewed/processed as needed by the user.\r\n\r\nThe DEBRIS software was created to accurately and efficiently analyze the debris transport environment for liberated debris from the Space Shuttle Launch Vehicle (SSLV) during ascent.  The motivation for its development is a consequence of the Columbia accident, where foam used to insulate the external tank dislodged during ascent and struck the wing leading edge of the Orbiter.  The resulting impact critically breached the thermal protection system for the wing, allowing hot gases to enter the structure of the vehicle, which led to the catastrophic loss of crew and vehicle.\r\n"

It performs conceptual designs of advanced life support (ALS) subsystems that recycle air and water and process wastes in order to reduce the need for resource resupply. ALSSAT is a means of investigating combinations of such subsystems' technologies and thereby assists in determining the most cost-effective technology combination available. Using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software with Visual Basic programming language, ALSSAT has been developed to perform multiple-case trade studies based on the calculated ECLSS mass, volume, power, and Equivalent System Mass, as well as parametric studies by varying the input parameters. ALSSAT's modular format is specifically designed for the ease of future maintenance and upgrades."

While these two document types offer different approaches for hazard identification and classification, they both offer controls for mitigating hazards. HMS provides a framework within which HA and JHA documents are created, reviewed, and approved. Once approved, the hazardous conditions identified within a document are considered active. More important, the controls associated with the hazards are then also considered active. HMS includes the mechanisms required to evaluate hazards using standard Risk Assessment Code (RAC) scoring."

      "description": "ALSSAT has been developed for use in the sizing and analysis of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) for spacecraft and habitats. The purpose of this tool is to perform life support system trade studies and analysis. ALSSAT aids in the creation of conceptual designs for advanced systems using physiochemical and biological processes in either open-loop systems or closed-loop systems that recycle air and water as well as process human waste products. The regenerative life support processes can be used as a means to decrease the amount of consumable re-supply required for a range of missions including in-space transit vehicles or habitats, and surface habitats on the moon or Mars. Since not all missions are long enough to payback the mass of the recycling hardware, or may not need all possible resources that could be recycled, determining the best suite of technologies to provide the right amount of resource recovery for each mission is very difficult.  Because so many technological combinations are possible, the development of an Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) was created as a means to investigate these combinations. This tool assists in the determination of the most mass effective and reliable combination of methods available for a steady-state operating condition. ALSSAT has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program and has been programmed to perform multiple-case mission scenarios through Visual Basic (VB) interface forms for data input and computational analysis of ALS subsystems. Based on the preliminary design considerations, the Advanced Life Support system mass, power, and volume are computed for various mission specifications. The results can be used as a guide to select the best system architecture."

Data and analyses of accelerations is important for phemomena and systems that are sensitive to gravity, such as multiphase fluid flow (e.g., gas and liquid concurrent flows).  These data measurements are required for parabolic, suborbital and/or space testing and operations to evaluate research and hardware under the dynamic and different test/operational environment in zero- and/or low-gravity. The current data viewer configuration was developed using the COTS Labview Runtime Engine executable available for free download from the National Instruments website (http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2012/3433/en/; http://ftp.ni.com/support/softlib/labview/labview_runtime/2012/Windows/LVRTE2012f3std.exe).  In addition, the viewer uses COTS apps for retrieval/transfer of data from an Apple iTouch into the customizable Labview program . Key features are the use of COTS executable/software and apps as applied to flight and/or space applications, the ability to easily customize the viewer (e.g., visual formats, precision data viewing), ease of interface to hand held device/computer, and minimal expenditure for development and implementation.

This abstraction method/layer provided the ground work from which was developed a \"Project Foundation\" that has now become the basic starting block for all of our web-based solution development.  This foundation drastically reduces project \"spin up\" time and standardizes data layer and other service interactions to ensure consistently high performing transactional solutions."

Currently, APET consists of a modified version of the Rotorcraft Noise Model (RNM, Version 7) coupled with the newly developed Spectral Attenuation Method (SAM) that contains the Ray Tracing Program (RTP) and two versions of a Greens Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) code. A third component of APET is an audibility prediction scheme based on the work of Abrahamson, initially called ICHIN (I Can Hear It Now) and further developed by Wyle Labs as AUDIB."

      "description": "The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) is a computer program designed to predict the scattered acoustic field that results from the interaction between a known incident sound and arbitrary three-dimensional surfaces immersed in a potential background flow. The technology is based on the equations of time-harmonic, linearized acoustics and employs equivalent sources for solving an exterior Helmholtz equation boundary value problem (BVP). The incident sound can be generated by the FSC using a collection of simple point multipoles (monopoles and dipoles), or it can be provided by the user from other prediction codes. Predictions for high-frequency/large scale-combinations yield linear systems with millions of unknowns and memory requirements beyond the capabilities of most advanced computer systems to date. The computational engine of the FSC has been totally redesigned to alleviate the frequency limitations of the code by employing numerical algorithms that drastically reduce computer resource utilization and take advantage of multiprocessor platforms."

The SCOREboards present an overview of multiple data points (the performance gaps and their durations, the corresponding gap closing tasks, task testing locations, mission need, and mission criticality) that when viewed together provide a roadmap of system maturation critical for the Journey to Mars. The SCOREboards are generated by a computer program that extracts data from the main repository, sorts the data based on a range of categories corresponding to the data structure, then plots the data according to specified user inputs. The ability to sort and plot varying data categories provides the flexibility to present specific SCOREboard capability roadmaps based on customer requests. "

      "description": "The Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation code (ParaGrandMC) is a highly parallelized code in FORTRAN for simulating the thermodynamic evolution of metal alloy systems at atomic level, and predicting their thermodynamic state, phase diagram, chemical composition and mechanical properties. The approach taken is based on evolving an initially given atomic system (defined through a list of atomic coordinates of all participating atoms) using Monte Carlo algorithm. The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process, internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. \r\n\r\nThe code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can also be used for any other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas interfaces.

There are several libraries provided as part of the Framework: a Core Library, a Pathfinder library, a Scene Generator library, a Synthesis library, a Signal Processing library, and a Scheduler library.  Each library contains a usable but very simple set of capabilities.  An example application and several test cases provided with the Framework demonstrate how to use the libraries together to perform auralization tasks.  It is expected that users will build their own customizations on the provided libraries, making use of the underlying framework, to create plugins for NAF that perform more complex operations."

The technique transforms one or more objective functions into reduced objective functions analogous to goal constraints used in the goal programming method. The reduced objective\r\nfunctions are appended to the set of constraints and an envelope of the entire function set is computed using the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function.  This envelope function is then searched for an unconstrained minimum. The technique may be categorized as a SUMT algorithm.  Version 3.1 is written in the FORTRAN 90/95 standard and improves upon the robustness of the code by preventing potential memory allocation errors."

The implementation is given the acronym RANSTEP for Reduced order Analysis using a Nonlinear STiffness Evaluation Procedure.  The nonlinear stiffness evaluation procedure allows computation of otherwise inaccessible modal nonlinear stiffness terms from commercial finite element programs.  Some operations are performed outside the commercial codes and utilize in-house developed FORTRAN codes.  Additionally Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP) alters and PYTHON scripts are used to facilitate implementations written about MSC.NASTRAN and ABAQUS, respectively.  Two solutions procedures of different fidelity and computational cost are offered in each implementation.  They are equivalent linearization and time numerical simulation. Aerospace uses include aircraft and spacecraft structural analysis."

The DSMC method is widely used for the modeling of gas flows through the computation of the motion and collisions of representative molecules.  Computation at the molecular level is necessary for studies in rarefied gas dynamics (RGD) because the transport terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are not valid in this flow regime.  The essential characteristic of a \"rarefied\" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible.\r\n\r\nThe software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature.  The gas model includes internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase chemical reactions, and surface reactions.  MAP uses an N-Level embedded Cartesian grid system and a separate surface geometry that is embedded within the grid that is made up of unstructured triangular elements."

Originally the intent was to use the model for testing simulation hardware and for demonstrations.  No proprietary data is used in the model.  Most of the coefficients are linearized, and based on the set of parameters provided in Roskam, Airplane Flight Dynamics (Reference 1) when available.  The intent was that any other transport aircraft could be modeled at the same level by providing the equivalent set of data.  (Appendix C describes levels of simulation modeling.)  This makes it possible to model different aircraft by reading in the values from a file."

      "description": "The design of trajectories for interplanetary missions represents one of the most complex and important problems to solve during conceptual space mission design. To facilitate conceptual interplanetary mission sizing activities, it is essential to obtain sufficiently accurate trajectories in a fast and repeatable manner. To this end, the VISITOR software tool was developed. This tool modularly augments a patched conic, multiple gravity-assist with one deep space manuever (MGA-1DSM) trajectory model with a mass model, launch window analysis, and the capability to simulate realistic arrival and departure operations. The tool was validated against seven flown missions: the average total mission delta-V offset from the nominal trajectory was 9.1%, and was reduced to 7.3% when using the genetic algorithm at the cost of an increase in computation time by a factor 5.7. VISITOR is well-suited for the conceptual design of interplanetary trajectories and facilitates future improvements due to its modular structure."

Before, building these models could take engineers weeks or even months to complete a single iteration.  Now the modeler tool can do the same task in minutes. The software creates many levels of model complexity, from single mirrors (circular or hexagonal shapes) to arrays of mirror segments.  Models can have local reinforcement surrounding attachment points, and mesh can be refined (doubled) as many times as necessary."

The tracing feature does not impose input/output requirements (e.g., print/write statements) on the targeted software because the tracing is performed by an outside program executing separately. The Timeliner-TLX language is currently used for auto-procedures on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Autonomous Mission Operations (AMO) project, and future manned deep-space missions will require the use of extensive auto-procedures to assist in remote intelligent operations.\r\n"

As astronomical and remote sensing detectors become more sensitive, proton flux can induce unwanted backgrounds in the instrumentation. The Low-Altitute Trapped Radiation Model, based on nearly 20 years of data from the TIRO/NOAA weather satellites, predicts the integral omindirectional proton flux in three energy ranges: &gt;16, &gt;36, and &gt;80 MeV. The model contains a true solar cycle variation and accounts for the secular variation in the Earth's magnetic field. "

ADAPT can automatically evaluate aerospike nozzle performance over a wide variation of independent design variables, and it can be used in concert with other built-in analysis techniques to optimize aerospike nozzles over an entire flight envelope. Any propellant system can be modeled. Outputs of the code include files that contain the thruster/spike contour and a summary output file for each thruster/spike design point, as well as vacuum and delivered performance data for the thruster and the entire thruster/spike module. One-dimensional performance data are also included for both the thruster and aerospike so that efficiencies and comparisons may be made."

      "description": "A software suite, developed to support NASAs in-flight characterization of commercial remote sensing systems, efficiently automates reproducible processing of ground truth data.  It is unique in that it takes input from a number of disparate data sources, condenses and rapidly processes it, to a form useable by the characterization process. It has been largely automated to reduce operator error as much as possible\r\nWritten and developed in the MATLAB programming environment, the characterization suite consists of radiometric, geometric and spatial scripts that require knowledge of MODTRAN and expertise to run. Each type of characterization relies on knowledge of ground characteristics, or ground truth, some of which must be acquired at the time of sensor overpass.  Examples of ground truth data include target reflectance, incident solar irradiance, atmospheric pressure and water vapor, aerosol content, and target location. All of these data sets must be processed in order to be used for in-flight characterization.\r\nPreviously used to perform radiometric, geometric, and spatial characterization on the IKONOS, QuickBird, OrbView-3, and AWiFS satellite sensors.\r\n"

      "description": "The Application Research Toolbox (ART) is a collection of computer programs that implement algorithms and parametric mathematical models for simulating remote sensing systems, developed in MATLAB. The ART is intended to be especially useful for performing design-tradeoff studies and statistical analyses to support the rational development of design requirements for multispectral imaging systems. Among other things, the ART affords a capability to synthesize coarser-spatial-resolution image-data sets from finer-spatial-resolution data sets and multispectral-image-data products from hyperspectral-image-data products. The ART also provides for synthesis of image-degradation effects, including point-spread functions, misregistration of spectral images, and noise. The ART can utilize real or synthetic data sets, along with sensor specifications, to create simulated data sets. In one example of a typical application, simulated data pertaining to an existing multispectral sensor system are used to verify the data collected by the system in operation. In the case of a proposed sensor system, the simulated data can be used to conduct trade studies and statistical analyses to ensure that the sensor system will satisfy the requirements of potential scientific, academic, and commercial user communities.  ART is designed to run on a standard Windows NT/2000 workstation and MATLAB version 6.5.  A Programmers Reference is included to provide additional detail on setting up the operational environment."

      "description": "An automated Spatial Resolution Verification Tool (SRVT) was developed to rapidly determine the spatial resolution characteristics of remotely sensed aerial and satellite imagery. Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).\r\n\r\nDeveloped using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired data set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a data set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.\r\nThe SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery."

Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a PID control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots determined using the K-method are also included. The code is commented for Graduate and Undergraduate students of aeroservoelasticity who want to know the basic concepts of medium fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. Not all methods are coded to industry standards. But students of the field including practicing engineers may find it useful for basic understanding; theoretical manuals for industry level codes tend to leave out many of the coding details. All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most of it is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications with one focusing on V&V with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data are also included."

This approach is much different than the Flight Software Branch's historical approach to unit testing that creates a log file that requires developer analysis in order to determine whether a test passed or failed. In order to use the tools a developer populates the framework with their unit tests and links with the ut-asssert library to create an executable. "

      "description": "The IVHM Project in the Aviation Safety Program has funded research in electrical power system (EPS) health management. This problem domain contains both discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented."

The initial primary goal of the system was to enable communication between small formations of cubesats or other small satellites, but the basic mesh architecture is applicable to data exchange between network assets of any type. The system has been flight tested on formations of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and shown to provide low latency data throughput for dynamic flight environments.",

      "description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

Forest preservation initiatives, carbon measurement initiatives, water management and agricultural monitoring are just few examples of causes that can benefit greatly from remote sensing data.  Currently, however, many developing nations lack the in-country expertise and computational infrastructure to utilize remote sensing data.\r\n\r\nThe CEOS Data Cube Platform provides a flexible model to address these needs.  The CEOS Data Cube Platform is a data processing platform for Earth science data, with a focus on remote-sensing data.  The platform provides a data ingestion framework that includes support for automated ingestion of a wide variety of remote sensing data products.  The data products are ingested into an N-dimensional data array that abstracts away management of distinct acquisitions.   The platform has a tiered API for data processing and a data/application platform layer for higher-level access."

The problem of severe heat is notably felt in Maricopa County, Arizona, where the socially disadvantaged and physically vulnerable are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Several organizations, including the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Phoenix Heat Relief Network, are working to create more effectively placed cooling centers and heat warning systems to aid those with the highest risk of exposure. This project created a Python tool using Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature parameters to generate heat maps that reference demographics data on extreme heat days.

      "description": "PolyCARP is a package of algorithms, including both their formal models and software implementations, for computing containment, collision, resolution, and recovery information for polygons. The intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to safety critical systems in air traffic management. One application is weather avoidance. A weather cell can be approximated by a polygon, and PolyCARP provides algorithms to detect whether a trajectory will intersect such a polygon in the near future and will provide maneuver guidance to avoid the polygon. If the trajectory is inside the polygon at the current time, PolyCARP provides algorithms for maneuver guidance to exit the polygon. Another application is ensuring that an aircraft stays inside a predetermined safety region, also known as assured containment, and PolyCARP provides algorithms that ensure that a point is inside or outside a particular polygonal region. Another application is obstacle avoidance by an aircraft. There are several functionalities provided by PolyCARP. There are algorithms to insure that a point is contained in or excluded from a polygon. There are also collision detection algorithms that determine if a moving point intersects a polygon, including the case where the polygon is moving or even warping over time, as well as where the polygon and the point are following piecewise linear trajectories. There are algorithms that resolve potential collisions between and point and a polygon by providing collision-free trajectories, and there are algorithms that compute new trajectories to regain separation from a polygon."

DAIDALUS consists of algorithms for determining the current well-clear status between two aircraft and for predicting a well-clear violation within a lookahead time, assuming non-maneuvering trajectories. In the case of a predicted well-clear violation, DAIDALUS also provides an algorithm that computes the time interval of well-clear violation. Furthermore, DAIDALUS implements algorithms for computing prevention bands, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model. Prevention bands are ranges of track, ground speed, and vertical speed maneuvers that are predicted to be in well-clear violation within a given lookahead time.\r\n"

The EEFS can be used on embedded systems where a file system is needed to access data from EEPROM, PROM, or RAM memory, but otherwise might not have the resources to deploy a full file system such as the MSDOS file system. The EEPROM file system can also be used in systems where the ability to dump, patch, and diagnose files is required. "

      "description": "OpenMDAO version 0.1 is the initial version of the next generation Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) open source framework.   OpenMDAO is the open source framework developed by NASA that will be accessible via an open source website to reach the entire broad based MDAO community to facilitate advancing the science of MDAO.  MDAO covers a vast set of capabilities, including a flexible framework and state of the art discipline codes.  This innovation relates specifically to the framework.  OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.  Currently, the OpenMDAO version 0.1 functionalities include component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves, the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications, error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs), plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing support.  To be clear, the framework will enable the integration of, but will not include: optimizers, solvers, visualization tools, custom data types, script components, and discipline codes.  AEROSPACE:  To meet the present and future economic and environmental challenges facing air transportation, aviation design must expand its focus from today's conventional \"wing-body-tail\" aircraft to more advanced vehicles.   The ability to design revolutionary aircraft to improve mobility and air transport efficiency is of paramount importance to the national economy, along with reducing our environmental impact and supporting national defense.   Technologies such as the one disclosed here incorporate progressively more sophisticated computational models and methods, enabling future aircraft designs today."

      "description": "This software supports FMI based model exchange with Trick based simulations. The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard was developed in partnership with governmental, academic and commercial entities in the European Union. This standard is used to support the exchange of component models for complex system simulations throughout Europe and the United States. Trick simulations are used all across NASA for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation to use an FMI compliant model (FMU)."

MMM-Py can read MRMS mosaics from either their unique binary format or their converted NetCDF format; it can also read and properly interpret the current mosaic design (4 regional tiles) as well as mosaics produced prior to late July 2013 (8 tiles). The technology can easily stitch multiple tiles together to provide a larger regional or national picture of precipitating weather systems. Composites, horizontal/vertical cross-sections, and combinations thereof are easily displayed using as little as one line of code."

A python script will pull out timing, brightness temperatures, and other information  from each channel/geolocation and store them as attributes using the appropriate type of numpy array. The approach consists of ingesting the entire file as a text string and then parsing and converting as necessary. The file is read and the data are populated when the class is instantiated with the full path and name of an AMPR file. Numerous visualization methods are provided, including track plots, strip charts, and Google Earth KMZs. In addition, polarization deconvolution is available."

Building upon a set of open source mapping and user interface libraries, it provides an environment to visually discover interesting phenomena as observed by NASA satellites, then download the data for further analysis.  It was originally designed to address the needs of the near real time applications community to provide relevant information for time-critical scenarios such as wildfire and flood management.  As such, satellite imagery is available to be viewed in Worldview within four hours of observation, the imagery can be viewed in its highest, or native, resolution, and the imagery can be panned and zoomed rapidly through space and time to find the most relevant/cloud-free/etc information available."

The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

      "description": "The Composite Damage (CompDam) Progressive Damage Analysis software is developed for the prediction of damage onset, damage progression and structural collapse of structures manufactured of fiber-reinforced plastic laminates. The emphasis has been on development of an analysis capability for application at the structural level. Hence, modeling of damage progression is undertaken at the meso-scale, where each ply of a laminate is represented as a homogenous orthotropic continuum. All of the composite damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, fiber breaking and kinking, and delamination) and their interactions are represented. The CompDam software is implemented as user written subroutines for use with the Abaqus commercial finite element code.  Input for CompDam includes ply-level material properties, and interface properties obtained from standard material characterization tests.  The output from CompDam includes damage variables associated with each damage mode. These damage variables describe the evolution of damage and are used to generate updated structural constitutive matrices and load redistribution as damage evolves. "

Dr. Freund's theory states that as stresses in the Earth\u2019s crust increase during the time leading up to a major earthquake, atomic-scale defects in the mineral grains and along the boundaries between mineral grains become activated. The ultimate goal of this project is to observe live anomalous EM field fluctuations and accurately forecast an earthquake within a specified geographical range."

Since then, it has been deployed and repurposed in other installations, including at the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC) in support of the State of the Oceans (SOTO) visualization tool, the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project (LMMP), and Worldview.",

The only required inputs are the surface crack dimensions (2c and a), plate cross-section dimensions (W and B), and linear plus power law material properties of elastic modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening coefficient. With the geometry and material parameters entered, TASC interpolates to the appropriate J(\u03a6) vs. crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and far-field tension stress, \u03c3, vs. CMOD solution, providing the full solution as CMOD ranges from zero out to the CMOD limit of the solution space for the given input parameters. TASC was developed by the Material and Processes Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.",

Multi-node cooperation allows different nodes to take part in the same task. Split file processing allows multiple threads to operate concurrently on the same file. Finally, additional optimizations such as buffer management help eliminate other bottlenecks that can reduce performance. Mutil currently includes drop-in replacements for cp and md5sum from GNU coreutils, which have achieved 10/30x rates on one/many nodes.",

Mesh adheres to fundamental security principles and was designed to be compatible with strong security mechanisms including two-factor authentication, SSH bastions, and restrictive firewalls. Mesh uses a remote command model, which is based on stock SSH clients and the syntax and commands already understood by users, thus requires no additional software or knowledge to utilize effectively.

The software was initially designed to compare ground radar reflectivity from operational, ground-based, S- and C-band meteorological radars with comparable measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite's Precipitation Radar instrument. The software is also applicable to other ground-based and space-based radars. The software allows both ground and space based radar data to be compared for validation purposes.",

The reason for having four different methods of FITS I/O with IDL is partly historical, as different groups developed the software independently. However, each method also has its own strengths and weakness for any particular task. For example, the procedure MRDFITS() -- which can read a FITS table into an IDL structure --is the easiest procedure for analyzing FITS files at the IDL prompt level (provided that one is comfortable with IDL structures). But mapping a table into an IDL structure includes extra overhead, so that when performing FITS I/O at the procedure level, it may be desirable to use more efficient procedures such as FITS_READ and FTAB_EXT.",

ALIAS consists of two processing subsystems for radiometric and geometric processing of the ALI\u2019s multispectral imagery. The radiometric processing subsystem characterizes and corrects, where possible, radiometric qualities including: detector operability; gain; bias; coherent, impulse and random noise; signal-to-noise ratios (SNR); saturation levels; striping and banding; and the stability of detector performance. The geometric processing subsystem and analysis capabilities support sensor alignment calibrations; sensor chip assembly (SCA)-to-SCA alignments and related issues; geodetic accuracy assessments; modulation transfer function (MTF) characterizations; and perform image-to-image characterizations. The ALIAS also characterizes and corrects band-to-band registration, and performs systematic, precision and terrain correction of ALI images. The ALIAS can geometrically correct and automatically mosaic the SCA image strips into a seamless, map-projected image. The ALIAS was developed through collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",

This functional paradigm for specifying a domain allows a clean separation between the domain of ontological modeling (i.e., the focus of the OMF Core Functional API) from specific bindings for standards-based technology frameworks such as W3C's OWL, OMG's UML/SysML and, potentially, others. More importantly, the functional nature of this OMF Core API allows decoupling algorithms for analyzing, constructing, auditing, verifying, reasoning about OMF ontological models independently of the particular technology in which these ontological models are represented.",

Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) are low-dimensional, discrete representations of a given random vector being modeled that facilitate efficient stochastic calculations. SROMs can be viewed as a smart Monte Carlo method - using the concept for uncertainty propagation is similarly straightforward, but can significantly reduce computation time. An SROM is formed for a given target random vector by solving an optimization problem that determines it's parameters by minimizing the error between the statistics of the SROM and the target. Once the SROM is formed, it can be use to efficiently perform a probabilistic analysis. The SROMPy software package is a tool to solve the optimization problem efficiently to generate an SROM that can be used to propagate uncertainty through a given model.",

The first one extracts average NDVI values from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 image collections for specified reference dates (typically a period of 10-15 years). Anomalies in NDVI values are then derived from Landsat 5 & 8 reference image collections from later dates (typically the year after the reference period to present). Various graphs and charts are produced showing positive and negative NDVI changes for specified points. The results are also visualized on the map as either areas of NDVI gain (displayed in green) or NDVI loss (displayed in red). The second types of scripts included scripts that perform unsupervised classifications to determine marsh extent for a variety of years and were made by applying a mask over the specified study area that incorporates elevation data to exclude regions over a specified height above average sea-level. These scripts require the user to choose classified pixel clusters that represent marsh land cover by using the Google Earth Inspector tab and then entering those values into the script to generate the marsh extent maps. Results of these scripts include classification maps for various years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc.). The user can then decide to export those results into either their Assets or their Drive, or both. A third type of script is used for statistics regarding the classified maps generated in the classification scripts. These statistics include total pixel number and total marsh area calculated into square meters after the marsh extent pixels are clipped to our study area (the State of Maryland).",

The package assumes that users have already set up a registration account(s) with Earthdata login as well as authorizing NASA GESDISC data access. Please refer to  https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access for further details. The package relies on 'curl' (https://curl.haxx.se/) commands and library to access and download data from NASA remote sensing servers.  Since Mac users have curl as part of macOS, Windows users should make sure that their local machines have 'curl' installed properly.  Creating the .netrc file at the user machine 'Home' directory and storing the user NASA GESDISC logging information in it is needed to execute the package commands. Instructions on creating the .netrc and .urs_cookies files can be accessed at https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget.",
