    "description": "SequenceMiner was developed to address the problem of detecting and describing anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences. The technology performs unsupervised clustering (grouping) of sequences using the normalized longest common subsequence (LCS) as a similarity measure, followed by a detailed analysis of outliers to detect anomalies. SequenceMiner utilizes a new hybrid algorithm for computing the LCS that has been shown to outperform existing algorithms by a factor of five.",
